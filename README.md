# Energy-Efficiency
Data Set Information:
We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ
with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, overall height, relative compactness and the orientation, amongst other
parameters.



Problem-Statement:
The effect of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof
area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on two output
variables, namely heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL), of residential buildings is
investigated using a statistical machine learning framework. We have to use a number
of classical and non-parametric statistical analytic tools to carefully analyze the
strength of each input variable's correlation with each of the output variables in order
to discover the most strongly associated input variables. We need to estimate HL and
CL, we can compare a traditional linear regression approach to a sophisticated
state-of-the-art nonlinear non-parametric method, random forests.
